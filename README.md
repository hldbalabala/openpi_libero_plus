# openpi on libero plus

## Requirements

To run the models in this repository, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with at least the following specifications. These estimations assume a single GPU, but you can also use multiple GPUs with model parallelism to reduce per-GPU memory requirements by configuring `fsdp_devices` in the training config. Please also note that the current training script does not yet support multi-node training.

| Mode               | Memory Required | Example GPU        |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Inference          | > 8 GB          | RTX 4090           |
| Fine-Tuning (LoRA) | > 22.5 GB       | RTX 4090           |
| Fine-Tuning (Full) | > 70 GB         | A100 (80GB) / H100 |

The repo has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04, we do not currently support other operating systems.

## Installation

When cloning this repo, make sure to update submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hldbalabala/openpi_libero_plus.git

# Or if you already cloned the repo:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies. See the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to set it up. Once uv is installed, run the following to set up the environment:

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv pip install -e .
```

NOTE: `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` is needed to pull LeRobot as a dependency.

**Docker**: As an alternative to uv installation, we provide instructions for installing openpi using Docker. If you encounter issues with your system setup, consider using Docker to simplify installation. See [Docker Setup](docs/docker.md) for more details.




## Model Checkpoints

### Base Models
We provide multiple base VLA model checkpoints. These checkpoints have been pre-trained on 10k+ hours of robot data, and can be used for fine-tuning.

| Model        | Use Case    | Description                                                                                                 | Checkpoint Path                                |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| $\pi_0$      | Fine-Tuning | Base [π₀ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0) for fine-tuning                | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_base`      |
| $\pi_0$-FAST | Fine-Tuning | Base autoregressive [π₀-FAST model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/research/fast) for fine-tuning | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi0_fast_base` |
| $\pi_{0.5}$    | Fine-Tuning | Base [π₀.₅ model](https://www.physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi05) for fine-tuning    | `gs://openpi-assets/checkpoints/pi05_base`      |

### Fine-Tuned Models
We also provide "expert" checkpoints for various robot platforms and tasks. These models are fine-tuned from the base models above and intended to run directly on the target robot. These may or may not work on your particular robot. Since these checkpoints were fine-tuned on relatively small datasets collected with more widely available robots, such as ALOHA and the DROID Franka setup, they might not generalize to your particular setup, though we found some of these, especially the DROID checkpoint, to generalize quite broadly in practice.

| Model                    | Use Case    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Checkpoint Path                                       |

By default, checkpoints are automatically downloaded from `gs://openpi-assets` and are cached in `~/.cache/openpi` when needed. You can overwrite the download path by setting the `OPENPI_DATA_HOME` environment variable.


## Troubleshooting

We will collect common issues and their solutions here. If you encounter an issue, please check here first. If you can't find a solution, please file an issue on the repo (see [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines).

| Issue                                     | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uv sync` fails with dependency conflicts | Try removing the virtual environment directory (`rm -rf .venv`) and running `uv sync` again. If issues persist, check that you have the latest version of `uv` installed (`uv self update`). |
| Training runs out of GPU memory           | Make sure you set `XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.9` (or higher) before running training to allow JAX to use more GPU memory. You can also use `--fsdp-devices <n>` where `<n>` is your number of GPUs, to enable [fully-sharded data parallelism](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/), which reduces memory usage in exchange for slower training (the amount of slowdown depends on your particular setup). If you are still running out of memory, you may way to consider disabling EMA.        |
| Policy server connection errors           | Check that the server is running and listening on the expected port. Verify network connectivity and firewall settings between client and server.                                            |
| Missing norm stats error when training    | Run `scripts/compute_norm_stats.py` with your config name before starting training.                                                                                                          |
| Dataset download fails                    | Check your internet connection. For HuggingFace datasets, ensure you're logged in (`huggingface-cli login`).                                                                                 |
| CUDA/GPU errors                           | Verify NVIDIA drivers are installed correctly. For Docker, ensure nvidia-container-toolkit is installed. Check GPU compatibility. You do NOT need CUDA libraries installed at a system level --- they will be installed via uv. You may even want to try *uninstalling* system CUDA libraries if you run into CUDA issues, since system libraries can sometimes cause conflicts. |
| Import errors when running examples       | Make sure you've installed all dependencies with `uv sync`. Some examples may have additional requirements listed in their READMEs.                    |
| Action dimensions mismatch                | Verify your data processing transforms match the expected input/output dimensions of your robot. Check the action space definitions in your policy classes.                                  |
| Diverging training loss                            | Check the `q01`, `q99`, and `std` values in `norm_stats.json` for your dataset. Certain dimensions that are rarely used can end up with very small `q01`, `q99`, or `std` values, leading to huge states and actions after normalization. You can manually adjust the norm stats as a workaround. |
